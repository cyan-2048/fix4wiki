# fix4wiki

This is a simple snippet to make [Wiki.js](https://js.wiki) compatible with KaiOS 2.x. The frontend uses some recent APIs not supported by the ancient version of Gecko. To use this software, simply embed a `script` tag in the head(using Wiki.js admin panel).

You either have to upload the snippet to somewhere of your own or use [jsdelivr CDN](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cyan-2048/fix4wiki/)

Currently, it is used on [the BananaHackers wiki](https://wiki.bananahackers.net)
