# fix4wiki

This is a simple snippet to make [Wiki.js](https://js.wiki) compatible with KaiOS 2.x. The frontend uses some recent APIs not supported by the ancient version of Gecko. To use this software, simply embed a `script` tag in the head(using Wiki.js admin panel). You should first upload `fix4wiki.min.js` somewhere.
